TLDR: Click VIEW CODE

What's up dudes. 

Most of the people who are sent here and including myself aren't super familiar with Github and for some reason I felt like this would be the appropriate home for my newsletters, so for now it's going to be a series of PDF dumps that you are free to download and read at your own leisure. If you have this link, it's likely because I personally invited you so if you have any feedback, you know how to get a hold of me. 

Click on the "View code" button above to see the dropdown of my current PDFs. So far the letters are my own opinions and prophetic encouragement that you need to carry with you in these days.

I hope to actually curate news items alongside these letters because most people don't really have a chance to consume all of the media and do the research to find the truth, but that's still a work in progress.. what I thought would be casual letters turned out to be a lot more work than I thought. If you want my quickly dumped ideas relating to the news items of the day, currently FB is the place for that -- but I don't expect the current media channels to be the ones that prevail in the end, hence the need for this repository and any that should come after.

Anyways: Happy Reading.
